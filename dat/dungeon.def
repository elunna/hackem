#
#	Gehennom
#
#	Now re-worked for 3.1, hell is hopefully going to be a little
#	less boring.  Also, in 3.1, the tower is not considered as a
#	part of hell, but is set up as a separate dungeon.
#
#	Gehennom is no longer considered "hellish" as a complete dungeon.
#	That is, fire resistance is no longer a condition for survival in
#	it.  However, Gehennom, and the special levels in it in particular,
#	is abundant with fire traps.  As a result, fire resistance is still
#	a prudent survival strategy in Gehennom.
#
#	Note:	Gehennom *must* be the second dungeon defined so that
#		monsters can properly migrate here under certain
#		circumstances.

#	The Mines of the Gnomes of Zurich.
#
#   KMH -- The Gnomish Mines are an important source of essential
#   items for low-level characters: food, armor, and tools.  Even a
#   short stay in the mines pays off.  Slash moved the entrance
#   deeper, penalizing many characters.  The balance patch restores
#   the entrance to levels 2 to 4.
